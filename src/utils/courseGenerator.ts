        content: `Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

## Key Concepts

### Definition
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

### Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled training data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds hidden patterns in data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns through interaction with environment

### Applications
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles`,

        content: `Understanding the fundamental difference between supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs. The algorithm learns from training data and makes predictions on new, unseen data.

### Examples:
- Classification: Email spam detection
- Regression: House price prediction

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns or structures in data without labeled examples. The algorithm must find patterns on its own.

### Examples:
- Clustering: Customer segmentation
- Association: Market basket analysis`,

### Components
React applications are built using components - reusable pieces of UI that can manage their own state and lifecycle.

### JSX
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.

### Virtual DOM
React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the actual DOM by comparing changes and updating only what's necessary.

### Props and State
- **Props**: Data passed from parent to child components
- **State**: Internal data that components can manage and update`,

### useEffect
Handles side effects like API calls, subscriptions, and DOM manipulation.

### useContext
Consumes context values without nesting.

### Custom Hooks
Create reusable stateful logic that can be shared across components.

## Best Practices
- Only call hooks at the top level
- Use dependency arrays properly in useEffect
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks`,

        title: 'Understanding Closures',
        content: `Closures are one of the most powerful and often misunderstood features in JavaScript.

## What is a Closure?

A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has returned.

## How Closures Work

When a function is created, it maintains a reference to its lexical environment. This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.

## Practical Examples

### Counter Function
\`\`\`javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    return ++count;
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
\`\`\`

### Module Pattern
Closures enable the module pattern, allowing for private variables and methods.

## Common Use Cases
- Data privacy and encapsulation
- Function factories
- Callbacks and event handlers
- Module patterns`,

## Promises

Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

### Promise States
- **Pending**: Initial state
- **Fulfilled**: Operation completed successfully
- **Rejected**: Operation failed

## Async/Await

Async/await provides a more readable way to work with promises.

\`\`\`javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}
\`\`\`

- Use .catch() with promises

### Third Normal Form (3NF)

- No transitive dependencies
